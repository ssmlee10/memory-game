Match the Missing Sock Pairs is a cozy game that involves the player helping Patty match her socks so they don't go missing!

Patty has experienced so many socks get lost in her laundry machine, in her hamper, and practically all over her house! 

The player has to match 8 pairs of socks in 50 moves or less otherwise, there's a chance her socks will go missing!

## Getting Started
[User Stories & Pseudocode](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WWRMNrkBkRLAMoWdcRns5wdnnlk12sz-SnJ3mMuA3M/edit?usp=sharing)

Here's a look at how the planning process started. I began by brainstorming what users would want to see and experience if they played a memory game. Then, I turned these stories into pseudocode. Doing this process helped me understand and create a game plan and actionable steps on how I could translate what I wanted from this game into Javascript language.
